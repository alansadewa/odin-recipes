    <p>Garlic, Parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and toasted nuts turn brown rice into a superstar stuffing in this Italian-inspired stuffed tomato side dish that's cooked in the air fryer.</p>

    <ul>
        <h2>The ingredients</h2>
        4 medium tomatoes
        <li>olive oil, as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup crumbled goat cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h2>How to make it</h2>
        <li>Cut tops off tomatoes and scoop out flesh with a melon baller, leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick sides and bottoms. Discard tomato tops and flesh.</li>

        <li>Brush the bottom of an air fryer basket with olive oil.</li>

        <li>Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place stuffed tomatoes into the prepared air fryer basket.</li>

        <li>Cook in the air fryer at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) until tomatoes are tender, filling is heated through, and topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Garnish with remaining basil.</li>
    </ol>
